# 2023_redPitaya_teamDefMatrix

This stores all of the code used to complete the Red Pitaya "Stranded in Space" 2023 Hackathon. Teams were required to implement the Red Pitaya board to achieve message transmission. 

 - We have successfully decoded the challenge Morse code, which was outputed at 57.6 KHz as a square wave.
 - The acquisition functions worked well in isolation, but faced some issues when called from the Python GUI (needs fixing)
 - The transmission function worked well in all scenarios, successfully transmitting a plaintext message encoded to Morse code.
